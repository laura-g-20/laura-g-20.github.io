## Welcome to my page!

I am a GIS and Mapping Specialist at the British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, UK, and this website gives you a brief introduction to me.   
I am currently completing a part-time, distance-learning Diploma in GIS and I created these pages for an assignment in the 'Programming for Geographical Information Analysts: Core Skills' module.
Have a look through the following pages to find out some more information about me and to see my first attempt at building a model in python.
