I have been working at the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge, UK since September 2016. I am primarily interested in topographic mapping and remote sensing of the polar regions. Further information can be seen on my [profile page](https://www.bas.ac.uk/profile/lauger/).

I currently use GIS in a fairly traditional way but I have been actively developing my skills over the last few years and am looking forward to incorporating coding into my work to improve efficiency and effectiveness.

I run a Helpdesk which supports a wide range of people and activities and produces around 200 outputs per year. A few photos of maps that I have produced are shown below. These give an idea of the range of projects that I work on.

I also manage BAS's portfolio of [published maps](https://www.bas.ac.uk/data/our-data/maps/) which need managing and updating every few years, as data availibility improves and glaciers and ice shelfs constantly change. Have a look through the portfolio if you are interested. All maps are available to purchase from a few different shops, including [Stanfords](http://www.stanfords.co.uk/).
