I have been working at the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge, UK since September 2016. Although I am a 'Mapping and GIS Specialist', I have no formal GIS qualification, hence completing the part-time GIS Diploma and creating this website. 


I run a Helpdesk which supports a wide range of people and activities and produces around 200 outputs per year. A few photos of maps that I have produced are shown below. These give an idea of the range of projects that I work on.
