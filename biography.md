I am a GIS and Mapping Specialist at the British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, UK with 3.5 years' professional work experience.
I studied Physical Geography and German BSc at Aberystwyth University and then continued to complete an MSc in Glaciology, also at Aberystwyth.

I live in Milton, Cambridge with my partner and our dog and one of my favourite things about Cambridge is being able to cycle everywhere!
