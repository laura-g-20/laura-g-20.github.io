I am a GIS and Mapping Specialist at the British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, UK with 3.5 year's professional work experience.
I studied Physical Geography and German BSc at Aberystwyth University and then continued to do an MSc in Glaciology, also at Aberystwyth.


I am a (semi-)active user of Twitter. Check out a recent tweet below and feel free to folloe me if you like hearing about mapping and GIS in the Polar Regions!
