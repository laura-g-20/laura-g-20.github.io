I was tasked with building an Agent Based Model as a way to learn a lot of the basics of python, following the instructions on this [website](https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/study/core-python-odl/) from Leeds University lecturer, Andy Evans.  

The code is commented and should make sense by itself, but I will also give a brief overview of what it does here: 

* Item1
* Item2
* Etc

The code is comprised of two files: a runtime file, [`model.py`](https://github.com/laura-g-20/laura-g-20.github.io/blob/master/model.py), and a class to describe the [`Agent.py`](https://github.com/laura-g-20/laura-g-20.github.io/blob/master/agentframework.py)

The files have been run and tested using Spyder (Python 3.7) on a Windows machine. The only other file you should need to run it is [in.txt](https://github.com/laura-g-20/laura-g-20.github.io/files/3722436/in.txt).
