# LAURA GERRISH

## Biography
I am a GIS and Mapping Specialist at the British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, UK with 3.5 year's professional work experience.
I studied Physical Geography and German BSc at Aberystwyth University and then continued to do an MSc in Glaciology, also at Aberystwyth.

I am currently completing a part time, distance learning Diploma in GIS with Leeds and Southampton universities. This website was built for an assignment in the 'Programming for Geographical Information Analysts: Core Skills' module.
I am interested in coding and want to improve my skills. 

I am a (semi-)active user of Twitter. Check out a recent tweet below and feel free to folloe me if you like hearing about mapping and GIS in the Polar Regions!
